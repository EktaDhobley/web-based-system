A web-based system in React.js
The objective of this system is to allow a user to upload a file and echo back information about the file and transpose the lines of the file. The user will be allowed to submit a custom name for the file being uploaded.

Upload Page:

the contents to be delivered will:

- Have a simple UI with 3 fields

- Field 1: A freeform text field that accepts a string argument for a custom filename

- Field 2: An upload button/area that allows the user to select a file for upload (bonus if you allow drag & drop)

- Field 3: A submit button that will submit the uploaded file and redirect you to the post-upload page.

Post upload page:

the contents to be delivered are 3 sets of data and 2 buttons:

- The original and selected filenames (string)

- The size of the file (integer - in bytes)

- The count of lines in the file (integer)

- A button that, if clicked, allows the user to download the file, with all lines in the file swapped (e.g. lines 1,3,5 become lines 2,4,6 and lines 2,4,6 become lines 1,3,5).

- A button for “upload another file” that simply redirects to the upload page.
